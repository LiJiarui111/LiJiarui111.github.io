I am a PhD student at [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://web.mit.edu/) (MIT), affiliated with the [Zardini Lab](https://zardini.mit.edu/) in the [Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems](https://lids.mit.edu/) (LIDS), where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Gioele Zardini](https://gioele.science/). Before joining MIT, I obtained my Bachelor of Engineering in Robotics Engineering from the [College of Engineering](http://en.coe.pku.edu.cn/) at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/), and worked as a visiting undergraduate student in the [Computational Robotics Group](https://computationalrobotics.seas.harvard.edu/), advised by [Prof. Heng Yang](https://hankyang.seas.harvard.edu/) at [School of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://seas.harvard.edu/) (SEAS), [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/).

<!-- Hahahahaha. Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
